This is a place to practice git. Your first exercise is to add your name to this list.
To complete this exercise you need to:

- **Learn to use git**:
  - Go through the try git tutorial at https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
  - Read the first two chapters of the book [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

  You should also go through the [curated list of git
resource](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/) provided by github to find other resouces to fit your need.

- **Fork the repo, create a new branch, make changes and send a pull request**
  - [This article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) should give you a good idea of what pull requests are how to use them.


Your entry should maintain alphabetic order and it should be in the format:

- `* your name [username](http://github.com/username)`.  

Some more guidelines:

* Your Pull Request must be rebased on the latest master.
* Your Pull Request must have only one commit (If there are multiple commits, you should squash them).
* This commit must have a message that resembles: `Add name to README (Name here)` (Use only first name in case the commit message goes over 50 characters).
* Name of the PR must be informative: `Add my name to the README (Name here)`.
* Only one file should be there in the diff of your Pull Request.

This file is written in the [Markdown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Lines starting with `*` are automatically rendered as bullet points and phrases containing `[name](URL)` are automatically hyperlinked.
